## üìñ Getting started

`$ yarn add react-native-photo-editor`

> This library is supported React Native V61 and above

- **iOS**

> **iOS Prerequisite:** Please make sure `CocoaPods` is installed on your system

	- Add the following to your `Podfile` -> `ios/Podfile` and run pod update:

```
  use_native_modules!

  pod 'RNPhotoEditor', :path => '../node_modules/react-native-photo-editor/ios'

  use_frameworks! :linkage => :static

  pod 'iOSPhotoEditor', :git => 'https://github.com/prscX/photo-editor', :branch => 'master'

  post_install do |installer|
    installer.pods_project.targets.each do |target|
      if target.name.include?('iOSPhotoEditor')
        target.build_configurations.each do |config|
          config.build_settings['SWIFT_VERSION'] = '5'
        end
      end
    end
  end

  # Follow [Flipper iOS Setup Guidelines](https://fbflipper.com/docs/getting-started/ios-native)
  # This is required because iOSPhotoEditor is implemented using Swift and we have to use use_frameworks! in Podfile
  $static_framework = ['FlipperKit', 'Flipper', 'Flipper-Folly',
    'CocoaAsyncSocket', 'ComponentKit', 'Flipper-DoubleConversion',
    'Flipper-Glog', 'Flipper-PeerTalk', 'Flipper-RSocket', 'Yoga', 'YogaKit',
    'CocoaLibEvent', 'OpenSSL-Universal', 'boost-for-react-native']
  
  pre_install do |installer|
    Pod::Installer::Xcode::TargetValidator.send(:define_method, :verify_no_static_framework_transitive_dependencies) {}
    installer.pod_targets.each do |pod|
        if $static_framework.include?(pod.name)
          def pod.build_type;
            Pod::BuildType.static_library
          end
        end
      end
  end

```

  - Please make sure [**Flipper iOS Setup Guidelines**](https://fbflipper.com/docs/getting-started/ios-native/) steps are added to Podfile, since iOSPhotoEditor is implemented using Swift and we have to use use_frameworks! in Podfile

  - If using React Native Firebase v6+, please see `Troubleshooting` section for a known issue before moving further.

  - Add below property to your info.list

```
	<key>NSPhotoLibraryAddUsageDescription</key>
	<string>Application needs permission to write photos...</string>

	<!-- If you are targeting devices running on iOS 10 or later, you'll also need to add: -->
	<key>NSPhotoLibraryUsageDescription</key>
	<string>iOS 10 needs permission to write photos...</string>
```

- **Android**

- Please add below script in your build.gradle

```
buildscript {
    repositories {
        maven { url "https://jitpack.io" }
        ...
    }
}

allprojects {
    repositories {
        maven { url "https://jitpack.io" }
        ...
    }
}
```


- Add below activity in your app activities:

`
<activity android:name="com.ahmedadeltito.photoeditor.PhotoEditorActivity" />
<activity android:name="com.yalantis.ucrop.UCropActivity" />
`

- To save image to the public external storage, you must request the WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE permission in your manifest file:

`<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE" />`

## ‚õÑÔ∏è Stickers

If you want stickers, please add them to your native project:

* **iOS:** Add stickers to iOS Resources folder
* **Android:** Add stickers to app `drawable` folder

> Refer Example project for the same.

## üíª Usage

```
import PhotoEditor from 'react-native-photo-editor'

PhotoEditor.Edit({
    path: RNFS.DocumentDirectoryPath + "/photo.jpg"
});
```

> * Purpose of this library is to edit photos which are within app sandbox, we recommend to move captured image to app sandbox then using RNFS share image path with library for the edit.

> * Example: If we capture image through cameraRoll then we should first move image to app sandbox using RNFS then share app storage path with the editor.

## üîß Troubleshooting
### If using React Native Firebase v6+ or facing any of the following issues: [#104](https://github.com/prscX/react-native-photo-editor/issues/104), [#93](https://github.com/prscX/react-native-photo-editor/issues/93)
  - Add the following to your `podfile -> ios/podfile` and run `pod install`
```
pre_install do |installer|
  installer.pod_targets.each do |pod|
    if pod.name.start_with?('RNFB')
      def pod.build_type;
        Pod::BuildType.static_library
      end
    end
  end
end
```

  - If the above doesn't work, try the following and and re-run `pod install`:

As [@react-native-firebase documentation](https://rnfirebase.io/#allow-ios-static-frameworks) you should add following to top of the Podfile for Allow iOS Static Frameworks
```
$RNFirebaseAsStaticFramework = true
```

## üíñ Support my projects
I open-source almost everything I can, and I try to reply everyone needing help using these projects. Obviously, this takes time. You can integrate and use these projects in your applications for free! You can even change the source code and redistribute (even resell it).

However, if you get some profit from this or just want to encourage me to continue creating stuff, there are few ways you can do it:
* Starring and sharing the projects you like üöÄ
* If you're feeling especially charitable, please follow [prscX](https://github.com/prscX) on GitHub.
